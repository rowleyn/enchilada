 * SQLDivider implements the abstract methods of CollectionDivider.

 * dividing which contains only those particles from the super 
 * collection which meet the WHERE criteria.  Make sure the clause is
 * valid because it will not be checked by SpASMS.  The collection 
 * description is generated from the WHERE clause as well.  If you 
 * get errors, you may have to remove reserved characters from it 
 * before setting the Description using the private method 
 * removeReservedCharacters() if the string contains any characters
 * that will interrupt SQL Server's reading it as a string.
